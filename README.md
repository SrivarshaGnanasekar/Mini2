# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

In the age of digital streaming, the sheer volume of available content can be overwhelming for viewers. With platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime offering thousands of movies and TV shows, users often struggle to find content that aligns with their tastes and preferences. This is where a movie recommendation system becomes invaluable.

A movie recommendation system is a sophisticated tool designed to analyze user behavior and preferences to suggest films they are likely to enjoy. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, these systems can provide personalized recommendations, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system that suggests films to users based on their preferences, viewing history, and other users' ratings, utilizing data analytics techniques to enhance user experience and engagement.

This project explores two main recommendation techniques:

- **Collaborative Filtering**:  
  Relies on the idea that users who have agreed in the past will agree in the future. By analyzing user ratings and behaviors, the system identifies patterns and similarities among users to recommend movies that similar users have enjoyed.

- **Content-Based Filtering**:  
  Focuses on the attributes of the movies themselves. By analyzing features such as genre, director, cast, and plot keywords, the system recommends movies that share similar characteristics with those the user has previously liked.

## Steps to Run

1. **Files Provided**  
   - The main code file (e.g., `filename.py`)  
   - The movies CSV dataset

2. **Image Customization**  
   - Replace the image background in the code with an image of your choice for a personalized appearance.

3. **Required Libraries**  
   Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
   - `pandas`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `streamlit`
   - `sklearn`
   - `seaborn`

   You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib streamlit scikit-learn seaborn
   ```

4. **Running the Application**  
   In your terminal, use the following command:
   ```bash
   python -m streamlit run filename.py
   ```
   *(Replace `filename.py` with the actual name of your code file.)*

## Notes

- Make sure the CSV file and the main code file are in the same directory, or update the code with the correct path to the CSV.
- Customize the background image in the code as desired.
